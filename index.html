        <p>Welcome to my personal website!</p>
        <p>I am a math student at the University of Texas at Austin, graduating in 2023.</p>
        <p>I enjoy programming, so if you want, you can check out my Github <a href="https://www.github.com/noocsharp">here</a>.</p>
        <p>When I have time, I also like to mess around on the piano. If I ever come up with anything good, I’ll post it <a href="sounds.html">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Having just started this website, I like to think that I’ll upload writing here occasionally. It is still to be seen whether that will actually happen, but if it does, it’ll probably be <a href="words.html">here</a>.</p>
        <p>If you need to contact me, you can email me at <a href="mailto://nihal.jere@gmail.com">nihal.jere@gmail.com</a>.</p>
