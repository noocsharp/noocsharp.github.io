# Nihal Jere

Welcome to my personal website!

I am a math student at the University of Texas at Austin, graduating in 2023.

I enjoy programming, so if you want, you can check out my Github [here](https://www.github.com/noocsharp).

When I have time, I also like to mess around on the piano. If I ever come up with anything good, I'll post it [here](sounds.html).

Having just started this website, I like to think that I'll upload writing here occasionally. It is still to be seen whether that will actually happen, but if it does, it'll probably be [here](words.html).

If you need to contact me, you can email me at [nihal.jere@gmail.com](mailto://nihal.jere@gmail.com).
